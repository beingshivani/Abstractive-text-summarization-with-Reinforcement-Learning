# Abstractive-text-summarization-with-Reinforcement-Learning
Develop an abstractive text summarization system

Run fine_tune.py to finetune the baseline model for summarization
Run rl_finetune.py to perform RL fine tuning in the model for summerization
Run evaluate.py to generate summary from the the models (baseline and RL finetune)
